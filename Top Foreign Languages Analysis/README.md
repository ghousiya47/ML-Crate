| Linear Regression         | 17.09     | 0.84     | 60.72     | 0.49      |
| Ridge Regression          | 85.65     | 0.22     | 96.16     | 0.20      |
| Elastic Net Regression    | 105.0     | 0.04     | 114.7     | 0.047     |
| Decision Tree Regression  | 0.00      | 1.00     | 61.30     | 0.49      |

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Load the dataset which is in zip file format unzipped it and than concatenated all 8 CSV files.
* After Concatenation it contains 34442 entries in it and having 12 columns in it.
* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly.
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Plotting heatmap using correlation and checking the relation between different features.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with target variable using plotting libraries.
* Train the datasets by different models and saves their accuracies into a dataframe.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Sklearn
4. NumPy
5. XGBoost
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras
8. Sci-py
9. Seaborn
10. missingno
11. plotly


**CONCLUSION**

- Random Forest and Linear Regression models show promising performance with lower MSE and higher R2 values.
- Decision Tree Regression achieved perfect R2 on the training set but performed poorly on the test set, indicating overfitting.
- Deep Neural Network (NN) has a high MSE and approximately zero R2, suggesting poor performance on both training and test sets.
